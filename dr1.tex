\section{First Data Release } \label{sect:dr1}

The first data release (DR1) is specified to process the first six months of survey data.
Six months of processing time have been allocated to perform a final test of the software used to create the release, generate the data products, validate their scientific usefulness, document them (and any of their limitations), deliver them to partners including LSST Education and Public Outreach, and prepare the Data Access Center systems to handle them.
The sum of these time periods means that the expected release date for DR1 is one year after the start of survey operations.
If the start of the survey were to be, for example, 2022-10-01, then DR1 would be released before 2023-10-01 and would contain data from 2022-10-01 to 2023-03-31.

Alerts would be running in some limited form - A detailed analysis of alerts possibilities for year one is given in \citeds{DMTN-107}.


This Release would include some of the products from section 4 of \DPDD including:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Raw images
\item  Processed images and coadds
\item  Catalogs including

\begin{itemize}
\item Object Catalog
\item Source Catalog
\item Forces Photometry Catalog
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

For the first release we may not produce catalogs in crowded fields.
We may also not reproduce the SSObject catalog the  contents of which would be at MPC mostly already.

\subsection {DR1 Interface}
For DR1 we expect to have full science platform access as envisioned in \citeds{LSE-319}.
The availability of batch processing is not guaranteed for the first release
