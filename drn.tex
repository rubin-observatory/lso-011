\section{Subsequent Data Releases } \label{sect:drn}

Subsequent data releases (DR3 through DR11) are specified to process 2 through 10 years of survey data, and produce all products from \DPDD Section 4.
Each subsequent DR has been allocated one year to perform the data release tasks, even though the amount of data increases each time.
The sum of these time periods means that the expected release date for DR3 is three years after the start of survey operations, 18 months after the release of DR2; similarly, DR4 through DR11 are released 4 through 11 years after the start of the survey.
If the start of the survey were to be, for example, 2022-10-01, then DR3 would be released before 2025-10-01 and would contain data from 2022-10-01 to 2024-09-30.
