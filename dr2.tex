\section{Second  Data Release } \label{sect:dr2}

The second data release (DR2) is specified to process the first year of survey data.
Six months of processing time have been allocated to perform the data release tasks, as for DR1, but with twice the data. 
The sum of these time periods means that the expected release date for DR1 is 18 months after the start of survey operations.       
If the start of the survey were to be, for example, 2022-10-01, then DR2 would be released before 2024-04-01 and would contain data from 2022-10-01 to 2023-09-30.

DR2 and subsequent release should produce all products from \DPDD Section 4.
